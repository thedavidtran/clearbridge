# Clearbridge Mobile Engineering: Fun Front to Back

Welcome to the Clearbridge Mobile Engineering Full Stack code Challenge. We work on diverse projects and value team members who can do it all from CSS to DevOps and everything inbetween. We love to code and are passionate about doing it well.

This is your chance to show the team how you approach problems and give us insight into your abilities. For the challenge, you are required to design, develop, and style a Full Stack application using Node as the API and React as the front-end. Feel free to use any third party libraries you see fit. You will have **4 days** to submit a solution for the given requirements. If you need more time due to schedule conflicts, just let us know. We value people with good communication skills. We strongly prefer that whatever you do, you do it well, as opposed to trying to razzle dazzle us. Please read all the instructions carefully and email us if you have any questions.

Once you have completed all the sections, please update the README, to reflect how to build and run your application, as well as any architectural decisions you have made. Add your deployment url to your github repo so we can test the deployed application. When you believe you are ready to submit your challenge, submit a pull request into our master branch. We will see the notification and get back to you on next steps.
